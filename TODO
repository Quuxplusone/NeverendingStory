- separate the idea of "world model in memory" from "backing store" (DONE?)

- implement "backing store on local disk via pickling" (PARTIALLY DONE)
    when loading from disk, you have to merge the datasets

- implement a static-ish landing page

- nicer-looking CSS for "Create!" button

- nicer-looking CSS in general (steal from Parchment?)

- some kind of Ajax to get infini-scrolling instead of discrete pages?
